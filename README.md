# Temperature Converter – Java Console Application

This Java console application allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units. The user inputs a temperature value along with its original unit, and the program calculates and displays the equivalent values in the other two units.

## Key Features

- Accepts user input for temperature value and its corresponding unit (C, F, or K)
- Accurately converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
- Displays output with appropriate units for clarity

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- Java Scanner class for input handling
- Control flow using switch-case statements

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or use the terminal.
3. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac TemperatureConverter.java 
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java TemperatureConverter

# Sample Execution
```yaml
Enter temperature value:
25
Enter unit (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, K for Kelvin):
C
Fahrenheit: 77.0°F
Kelvin: 298.15K
```
## Learning Objectives
- Practice working with user input in Java
- Implement basic mathematical operations and conversion formulas
- Improve understanding of control structures (switch-case)
- Gain experience with formatting and displaying output
